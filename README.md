# Salesforce-Connector-and-Source
SSIS custom connection manager and source

The code in this repo provides almost bare bones connectivity to Salesforce and also as a source component to retrieve data from salesforce. It contains gui that allows you select the object you want to pull data from or for you to write a custom query to pull data from saleforces within SSIS.
